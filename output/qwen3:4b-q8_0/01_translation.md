On the tree above the lake,  
sat the Water Spirit in the evening:  
"Light, Moon, light,  
so that you may weave thread for me.  

I am sewing buttons for the boots,  
left and right:  
Light, Moon, light,  
so that you may weave thread for me.  

Today is Thursday, tomorrow is Friday â€”  
I am sewing a jacket:  
Light, Moon, light,  
so that you may weave thread for me.  

Green clothes, red boots,  
tomorrow my wedding will be:  
Light, Moon, light,  
so that you may weave thread for me."

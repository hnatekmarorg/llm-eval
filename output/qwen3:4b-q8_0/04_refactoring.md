Here is a refactored version of the Go code that reads the scene configuration from a YAML file instead of hardcoding the values. This version is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy configuration of the scene via YAML.

### ‚úÖ Refactored Code

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/hnatekmarorg/sunshine/core"
	"gopkg.in/yaml.v2"
	"image/png"
	"os"
)

// Scene represents the entire 3D scene to be rendered
type Scene struct {
	Camera    core.Camera
	Objects   []Sphere
}

// Sphere represents a sphere in the scene
type Sphere struct {
	Position []float64
	Radius   float64
}

func main() {
	// Open the YAML file
	file, err := os.Open("scene.yaml")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer file.Close()

	// Parse the YAML file into the Scene struct
	var scene Scene
	decoder := yaml.NewDecoder(file)
	if err := decoder.Decode(&scene); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Convert each Sphere to a RayMarchableObject
	objects := make([]core.RayMarchableObject, len(scene.Objects))
	for i, s := range scene.Objects {
		objects[i] = core.NewSphere(s.Position, s.Radius)
	}

	// Render the scene
	image := scene.Camera.Render(objects)

	// Save the rendered image to a PNG file
	f, _ := os.Create("output.png")
	defer f.Close()
	png.Encode(f, image)
}
```

### üìÅ YAML File Example (`scene.yaml`)

```yaml
scene:
  camera:
    width: 512
    height: 512
    direction: [0, 0, 1]
  objects:
    - sphere:
        position: [0, 0, -2]
        radius: 1
    - sphere:
        position: [1, 0, -2]
        radius: 1
    - sphere:
        position: [0.5, 1, -2]
        radius: 1
    - sphere:
        position: [0, 0, -0.5]
        radius: 0.1
```

### üß† Key Improvements

- **YAML Configuration**: The scene is now loaded from a YAML file, making it easy to configure without changing the code.
- **Structs for Clarity**: `Scene` and `Sphere` structs are defined to represent the scene configuration and individual objects.
- **Type Safety**: The YAML is parsed into a `Scene` struct, and each `Sphere` is converted into a `core.RayMarchableObject` using `core.NewSphere`.
- **Modular Design**: This structure is easily extendable to support additional object types or camera configurations in the future.

---

### üì¶ Dependencies

- **YAML Parser**: The `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` package is used to parse the YAML file.
- **Rendering Engine**: The `core` package (from the `sunshine` project) is responsible for rendering the scene.

This approach maintains the original functionality while improving maintainability and flexibility.

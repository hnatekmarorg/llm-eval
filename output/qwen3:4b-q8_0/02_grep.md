To extract the UUID from the line:

```
GPU 0: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU (UUID: GPU-f0f6d00d-5367-e890-eea9-e568a84a7d53)
```

you can use the following command:

```bash
grep -Eo 'UUID: [^)]+' filename | sed 's/UUID: //'
```

### Explanation:

1. **`grep -Eo 'UUID: [^)]+' filename`**:
   - `-E` enables extended regular expressions.
   - `-o` ensures only the matched part is output.
   - `'UUID: [^)]+'` matches the string starting with `UUID: `, followed by one or more characters that are **not `)`** (i.e., everything up to the closing parenthesis).

2. **`sed 's/UUID: // '`**:
   - Removes the `UUID: ` prefix from the matched text, leaving only the UUID.

### Example:

Given the input line:

```
GPU 0: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU (UUID: GPU-f0f6d00d-5367-e890-eea9-e568a84a7d53)
```

The command will output:

```
GPU-f0f6d00d-5367-e890-eea9-e568a84a7d53
```

### Alternative (Simpler) Approach:

If the UUID is the **last word** in the line (which is the case in your example), you can use:

```bash
grep 'UUID: ' filename | awk '{print $NF}'
```

This will also extract the UUID correctly.

---

### Summary:

- **Recommended command**:  
  ```bash
  grep -Eo 'UUID: [^)]+' filename | sed 's/UUID: //'
  ```

This method is robust and handles cases where the UUID is embedded in parentheses.

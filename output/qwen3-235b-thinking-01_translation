On the poplar above the lake,  
the Water Goblin sat at twilight:  
"Shine, little moon, shine,  
so I can sew my thread.  

I'm sewing, sewing little shoes  
for dry land and water's flow,  
shine, little moon, shine,  
so I can sew my thread.  

Today is Thursday, tomorrow Fridayâ€”  
I'm sewing, sewing my little coat,  
shine, little moon, shine,  
so I can sew my thread.  

Green gown, red little boots,  
tomorrow's my wedding day,  
shine, little moon, shine,  
so I can sew my thread."

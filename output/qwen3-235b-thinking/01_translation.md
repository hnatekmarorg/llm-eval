On the poplar above the lake,  
The Water Sprite sat as evening fell:  
"Shine, little moon, shine so bright,  
So I can sew by your light.  

Sewing, sewing little shoes,  
For dry paths and streams so slight:  
Shine, little moon, shine so bright,  
So I can sew by your light.  

Today's Thursday, tomorrow Fridayâ€”  
Sewing, sewing my coat with glee:  
Shine, little moon, shine so bright,  
So I can sew by your light.  

Green dress, red shoes, ready to wed,  
Tomorrow my wedding day's ahead:  
Shine, little moon, shine so bright,  
So I can sew by your light."

The poem is a whimsical, almost lullaby‑like chant of a water‑spirit who, under the moonlight, is busy stitching all the garments he’ll need for his upcoming wedding. The refrain “Shine, little moon, shine, let the thread do the sewing for me” repeats after each stanza, giving the piece its rhythmic, incantatory feel.

Here is the translation of the poem into English:

---

**On the bank by the lake,  
sat the Water Sprite at twilight:  
"Shine, little moon, shine,  
so I may weave the thread.**

**Weaving, weaving my little boots,  
for both land and water suits:  
Shine, little moon, shine,  
so I may weave the thread.**

**Today is Thursday, tomorrow is Fridayâ€”  
Weaving, weaving myself a jacket:  
Shine, little moon, shine,  
so I may weave the thread.**

**Green dresses, red shoes,  
Tomorrow my wedding is due:  
Shine, little moon, shine,  
so I may weave the thread.**

This translation aims to preserve the essence and rhythm of the original Czech poem while making it accessible to an English-speaking audience. The tone and whimsical nature of the water sprite are maintained, as are the repetition and imagery.

On a willow tree over the lake  
sitting the Water Nymph at dusk:  
"Shine, moon, shine,  
so that I may spin a thread.  

I'm weaving, I'm weaving my little boots  
for dry land and for water:  
Shine, moon, shine,  
so that I may spin a thread.  

Today is Thursday, tomorrow is Friday â€”  
I'm weaving, I'm weaving my coat:  
Shine, moon, shine,  
so that I may spin a thread.  

Green clothes, red boots,  
tomorrow my wedding will be:  
Shine, moon, shine,  
so that I may spin a thread."

To solve this problem, we need to complete the `Init` method for the `Ray` struct in Go. The `Ray` struct has two fields: `origin` and `direction`, both representing 3D vectors. The `Init` method should initialize a new `Ray` instance with the provided origin and direction vectors.

### Approach
The approach involves creating a new instance of the `Ray` struct and assigning the provided origin and direction vectors to its fields. Since the `Init` method has a value receiver (not a pointer receiver), it returns a new `Ray` struct instead of modifying an existing one. This is straightforward and involves:
1. Creating a new `Ray` struct.
2. Assigning the provided `origin` and `direction` vectors to the corresponding fields of the new struct.
3. Returning the newly created `Ray` struct.

### Solution Code
```go
func (r Ray) Init(origin []float64, direction []float64) Ray {
    return Ray{origin: origin, direction: direction}
}
```

### Explanation
- **Method Signature**: The `Init` method takes two parameters, `origin` and `direction`, both of type `[]float64`, representing the 3D vectors for the starting point and direction of the ray.
- **Return Value**: The method returns a new `Ray` instance with the `origin` and `direction` fields set to the provided vectors.
- **Implementation**: The implementation is concise. It directly creates and returns a new `Ray` struct with the provided vectors as its fields. This approach ensures that each call to `Init` produces a new, initialized `Ray` instance, adhering to Go's value semantics when dealing with structs.

This solution efficiently initializes a `Ray` object and is tailored for use cases where new ray objects need to be created with specific origin and direction vectors.

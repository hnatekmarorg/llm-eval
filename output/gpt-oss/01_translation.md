the water‑sprite sat at dusk:  

```
“Shine, little moon, shine,
let the thread stitch for me.”
```

for the dry and for the wet:  

```
Shine, little moon, shine,
let the thread stitch for me.
```

Shine, little moon, shine,
let the thread stitch for me.
```

*my wedding will be tomorrow*:

### Notes on wording

- **Vodník** – a water spirit from Czech (and broader Slavic) folklore.  
- **Měsíčku** – a diminutive, literally “little moon”.  
- **Sviť** – imperative “shine”.  
- **ať mi šije niť** – literally “let the thread sew for me”; rendered here as “let the thread stitch for me”.  
- **do sucha i do vodičky** – “for the dry and for the wet (places)”.  
- **zejtra** – colloquial for *zítra* – “tomorrow”.  

Feel free to adapt the phrasing further if you need a more lyrical or a more literal rendering.

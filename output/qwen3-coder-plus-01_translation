Here's the English translation of the Czech poem:

```
On the willow by the lake
sat the Water Sprite at dusk:
"Shine, little moon,
so I can sew my thread.

I'm weaving, I'm weaving my shoes
dry and in the water too:
shine, little moon,
so I can sew my thread.

Today is Thursday, tomorrow Friday â€”
I'm weaving, I'm weaving my little cap:
shine, little moon,
so I can sew my thread.

Green dresses, red boots,
tomorrow my wedding will be:
shine, little moon,
so I can sew my thread."
```

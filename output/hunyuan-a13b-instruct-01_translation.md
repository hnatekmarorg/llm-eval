Here's a translation of the poem, aiming to preserve its rhythm, simplicity, and charm:

By the poplar over the lake
Sat the Water Sprite at dusk:
"Shine, little moon, shine,
So my boots don't get soaked.

I'll sew, I'll sew my little boots
To keep them dry both in dry land and wet;
Shine, little moon, shine,
So my boots don't get soaked.

Today is Thursday, tomorrow Friday â€”
I'll sew, I'll sew my little jacket:
Shine, little moon, shine,
So my boots don't get soaked.

Green dress, red boots,
Tomorrow will be my wedding day:
Shine, little moon, shine,
So my boots don't get soaked."

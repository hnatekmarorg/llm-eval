On a willow by the lake  
Sat the Water Sprite at dusk:  
"Shine, moon, shine,  
So I may thread my needle.  

I’m sewing my little shoes,  
For dry land and for waters too:  
Shine, moon, shine,  
So I may thread my needle.  

Today’s Thursday, tomorrow Friday—  
I’m sewing my coat with care:  
Shine, moon, shine,  
So I may thread my needle.  

Green dress, red little shoes,  
Tomorrow’s my wedding day:  
Shine, moon, shine,  
So I may thread my needle."

On a willow by the lake  
Sat the Water Sprite at dusk:  
"Shine, moon, shine,  
So I may thread my needle.

I sew, I sew my little shoes,  
For dry land and for waters too:  
Shine, moon, shine,  
So I may thread my needle.

Today is Thursday, tomorrow Friday —  
I sew, I sew my coat so fine:  
Shine, moon, shine,  
So I may thread my needle.

Green dress, red little shoes,  
Tomorrow’s my wedding day, it's true:  
Shine, moon, shine,  
So I may thread my needle."

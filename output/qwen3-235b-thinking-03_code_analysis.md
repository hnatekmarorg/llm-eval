# Code Analysis: Knight's Tour Simulation

This Python code simulates a knight's movement on a 10x10 chessboard, visualizing the path it takes using a depth-first search approach.

## Key Components

### Data Structure
```python
matrix = [[False for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]
```
- Creates a 10x10 grid where `False` represents unvisited squares and `True` represents visited squares.

### Knight Movement Logic
```python
def knight(x: int, y: int):
    return [
        (x + 1, y + 2),
        (x + 2, y + 1),
        (x + 2, y - 1),
        (x + 1, y - 2),
        (x - 1, y - 2),
        (x - 2, y - 1),
        (x - 2, y + 1),
        (x - 1, y + 2),
    ]
```
- Returns all 8 possible knight moves from any given position (x,y).

### Movement Execution
```python
def jump(matrix, x: int, y: int):
    positions = []
    for (ox, oy) in knight(x, y):
        if ox < 0 or oy < 0:
            continue
        try:
            if matrix[ox][oy]:
                continue
            matrix[ox][oy] = True
            positions.append((ox, oy))
        except IndexError:
            pass
    return matrix, positions
```
- Checks each knight move for validity:
  - Skips negative coordinates
  - Catches `IndexError` for coordinates beyond grid bounds (a less efficient approach)
  - Only adds unvisited positions to the exploration list

## Algorithm Characteristics

### Depth-First Search Implementation
```python
positions = [(0, 0)]
matrix[0][0] = True
while len(positions) != 0:
    x, y = positions.pop()  # LIFO behavior (depth-first)
    matrix, new_positions = jump(matrix, x, y)
    print_matrix(matrix)
    positions += new_positions  # Appends to end of list
    time.sleep(0.5)
```
- Uses a stack (`pop()` without index) for exploration order
- Always explores the most recently discovered position first
- Visualizes progress with half-second delays between steps

### Critical Observations

1. **Chessboard Parity Limitation**:
   - Knights alternate between black and white squares with each move
   - Starting from (0,0), it can only reach squares where (x+y) is odd
   - Approximately 50 of the 100 squares will be reachable

2. **Boundary Checking Issue**:
   ```python
   if ox < 0 or oy < 0:
       continue
   try:
       # ...
   except IndexError:
       pass
   ```
   - Checks negative coordinates explicitly but relies on exception handling for upper bounds
   - More efficient approach would be: `if not (0 <= ox < 10 and 0 <= oy < 10): continue`

3. **Visualization Feature**:
   - Prints the current state of the board after each move
   - Uses "X" for visited squares and spaces for unvisited ones
   - Creates a visual animation of the knight's exploration path

## Execution Flow

1. Starts at position (0,0)
2. Explores all valid knight moves from current position
3. Marks visited squares and adds new positions to exploration list
4. Continues until no more reachable unvisited squares remain
5. Visualizes each step with a half-second delay

## Conclusion

This code implements a depth-first search for a partial knight's tour on a 10x10 chessboard. While it correctly visualizes the knight's movement pattern, it has two notable limitations:

1. It cannot visit all squares due to the inherent parity constraint of knight moves
2. The boundary checking could be optimized by explicitly checking upper bounds rather than using exception handling

The visualization aspect is well-implemented, making it useful for understanding how a depth-first search explores possible knight moves on a chessboard.

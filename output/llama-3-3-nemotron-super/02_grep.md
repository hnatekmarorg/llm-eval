To extract only the UUID from the given string using `grep`, you can utilize Perl-compatible regular expressions (`-P` option) with a **positive lookbehind** to match the UUID that follows the pattern `UUID: ` and stops before the closing parenthesis `)`.

### ✅ **Final Command:**

```bash
echo "GPU 0: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU (UUID: GPU-f0f6d00d-5367-e890-eea9-e568a84a7d53)" | \
grep -oP '(?<=UUID: )[^)]+'
```

**Output:**

```
GPU-f0f6d00d-5367-e890-eea9-e568a84a7d53
```

---

### 🧠 **Explanation:**

- `grep -oP`: 
  - `-o` tells `grep` to output **only the matched part** of the line.
  - `-P` enables **Perl-compatible regular expressions**, which allow for advanced features like lookbehinds and lookaheads.

- `(?<=UUID: )`: 
  - This is a **positive lookbehind** assertion. It ensures that the match **starts after** the string `UUID: `, but this part is **not included** in the output.

- `[^)]+`:
  - This matches **one or more characters** that are **not closing parentheses**. It captures everything from the start of the UUID until the first closing parenthesis.

---

### 📌 **Why This Works Well:**

- It handles cases where the UUID is followed directly by a closing parenthesis without a space.
- It avoids including the `UUID: ` prefix or the closing parenthesis in the output.
- It's robust against variations in UUID format, as long as they are not enclosed in parentheses or contain spaces.

### 🛠️ **Alternative (Using `sed` if `grep -P` is Not Available):**

If your system doesn't support the `-P` option in `grep`, you can use `sed` as an alternative:

```bash
echo "GPU 0: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU (UUID: GPU-f0f6d00d-5367-e890-eea9-e568a84a7d53)" | \
sed -E 's/.*UUID: ([^)]+).*/\1/'
```

This uses a capture group to extract the UUID between `UUID: ` and the closing parenthesis.

### 📝 **Summary:**

To extract just the UUID from a line like:

```
GPU 0: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU (UUID: GPU-f0f6d00d-5367-e890-eea9-e568a84a7d53)
```

Use:

```bash
grep -oP '(?<=UUID: )[^)]+'
```

This is the most concise and effective method using `grep` alone.

**On a Poplar Over the Lake**  

On a poplar tree above the lake,  
The Water Spirit sat at dusk to make:  
"Shine, little moon, shine so bright,  
So that I can sew through the night.  

I’m sewing, sewing little boots,  
For land and water, my pursuits:  
Shine, little moon, shine so bright,  
So that I can sew through the night.  

Today is Thursday, Friday’s near—  
I’m sewing a jacket, my dearest dear:  
Shine, little moon, shine so bright,  
So that I can sew through the night.  

Green clothes, red boots so fine,  
Tomorrow my wedding will shine:  
Shine, little moon, shine so bright,  
So that I can sew through the night."

This translation preserves the poem's folkloric tone, repetitive structure, and rhyme scheme, while adapting the imagery and rhythm to flow naturally in English. The Water Spirit (Vodník) prepares for his wedding by sewing clothes under the moonlight, blending myth and tradition.

Here's the English translation of the Czech poem, preserving its rhythmic quality and folk tale feel:

**On a willow by the lake**  
**Sat the Water Goblin at dusk:**  
**"Shine, moon, shine,**  
**Let me sew my thread."**  

**"Sewing, sewing I sew little shoes,**  
**For dry land and for water too:**  
**Shine, moon, shine,**  
**Let me sew my thread."**  

**"Today's Thursday, tomorrow's Friday—**  
**Sewing, sewing I sew my jacket:**  
**Shine, moon, shine,**  
**Let me sew my thread."**  

**"Green dress, red shoes,**  
**Tomorrow my wedding will be:**  
**Shine, moon, shine,**  
**Let me sew my thread."**

### Translation Notes:
1. **Vodník** → Water Goblin: A common folklore spirit in Slavic myths who guards water bodies.
2. **Botičky** → Little shoes: Emphasizes the small, delicate nature of the footwear (fits for a goblin).
3. **Do sucha i do vodičky** → For dry land and for water too: Highlights the magical versatility of the shoes.
4. **Čtvrtek / pátek** → Thursday / Friday: Maintains the time progression while keeping the weekday names.
5. **Zelené šaty, botky rudé** → Green dress, red shoes: A classic folk attire color combo (green = nature, red = passion).
6. **Refrain ("sviť, měsíčku, sviť")** → "Shine, moon, shine": Keeps the incantatory, repetitive rhythm of the original.

The translation prioritizes rhyme, rhythm, and playful simplicity to mirror the nursery-like cadence of the Czech verse.

By the lake, on a poplar tree, the Water Sprite sat at dusk:  
"Shine, moon, shine,  
So that I may sew.  

I sew, I sew my little shoes  
For dry and for wet:  
Shine, moon, shine,  
So that I may sew.  

Today is Thursday, tomorrow Fridayâ€”  
I sew, I sew my coat:  
Shine, moon, shine,  
So that I may sew.  

Green dresses, little red shoes,  
Tomorrow is my wedding day:  
Shine, moon, shine,  
So that I may sew."

You can extract the UUID from that GPU information using several grep and sed approaches:

## Method 1: Using grep with PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions)
```bash
nvidia-smi -q -d GPU | grep -P 'GPU.*UUID:\s+\K.*' -o
```

## Method 2: Using grep with capturing groups
```bash
nvidia-smi -q -d GPU | grep -o 'UUID: [^)]*' | cut -d' ' -f2
```

## Method 3: Using sed (most portable)
```bash
nvidia-smi -q -d GPU | sed -n 's/.*UUID: \(.*\)/\1/p'
```

## Method 4: More specific pattern matching
```bash
nvidia-smi -q -d GPU | grep "UUID:" | awk '{print $2}'
```

## Method 5: If you want just the UUID part without "UUID:"
```bash
nvidia-smi -q -d GPU | grep "UUID:" | sed 's/.*UUID: //'
```

The output for all methods should be:
```
GPU-f0f6d00d-5367-e890-eea9-e568a84a7d53
```

**Note:** Make sure `nvidia-smi` is installed and you have the appropriate permissions to run it. The `-q` flag provides a concise query output, and `-d GPU` specifies that you want GPU details.

If you're specifically looking for GPU 0, you might also want to filter by that:
```bash
nvidia-smi -q -d GPU | grep -A5 -B5 "GPU 0" | grep "UUID:" | sed 's/.*UUID: //'
```

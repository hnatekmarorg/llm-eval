**Translation:**

On a poplar above the lake,  
Sat the Water Sprite at dusk's break:  
"Shine, little moon, shine,  
So I can sew my thread.  

I sew, I sew little boots,  
For both dry land and waters:  
Shine, little moon, shine,  
So I can sew my thread.  

Today is Thursday, tomorrow Friday —  
I sew, I sew a jacket:  
Shine, little moon, shine,  
So I can sew my thread.  

Green clothes, red little boots,  
Tomorrow my wedding will be:  
Shine, little moon, shine,  
So I can sew my thread."

**Notes:**  
- The refrain "Sviť, měsíčku, sviť, ať mi šije niť" is translated as "Shine, little moon, shine, so I can sew my thread" to preserve the rhythm and intent.  
- "Vodník" is kept as "Water Sprite," a common translation for this Czech folklore creature.  
- The structure mirrors the original's repetition and playful tone, with slight adjustments for natural English flow.

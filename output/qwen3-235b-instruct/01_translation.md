Upon a tree above the lake,  
a Water-Sprite sat at twilight's wake:  
"Shine, O moon, shine bright,  
so my thread I may stitch with light.  

I'm sewing, sewing little shoes,  
for dry land and for waters blue:  
shine, O moon, shine bright,  
so my thread I may stitch with light.  

Today's Thursday, tomorrow's Friday—  
I'm sewing, sewing my jacket gray:  
shine, O moon, shine bright,  
so my thread I may stitch with light.  

Green dress, and red shoes fine—  
tomorrow my wedding will be mine:  
shine, O moon, shine bright,  
so my thread I may stitch with light."

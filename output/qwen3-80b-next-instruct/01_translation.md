On the poplar tree above the lake,  
The Water Spirit sat at twilight:  
“Shine, little moon, shine,  
So that my thread may fly.  

I sew, I sew my little shoes,  
Dry or wet, through all the blues:  
Shine, little moon, shine,  
So that my thread may fly.  

Today is Thursday, tomorrow Friday—  
I sew, I sew my coat so nifty:  
Shine, little moon, shine,  
So that my thread may fly.  

Green dress, red shoes,  
Tomorrow is my wedding news:  
Shine, little moon, shine,  
So that my thread may fly.”

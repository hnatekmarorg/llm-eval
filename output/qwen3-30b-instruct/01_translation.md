On a willow by the lake  
Sat the Water Sprite at twilight:  
"Shine, moon, shine,  
So I may thread my needle.

I'm sewing my little shoes,  
For dry land and for water too:  
Shine, moon, shine,  
So I may thread my needle.

Today is Thursday, tomorrow Fridayâ€”  
I'm sewing my little coat:  
Shine, moon, shine,  
So I may thread my needle.

Green dress, red little shoes,  
Tomorrow's my wedding day:  
Shine, moon, shine,  
So I may thread my needle."

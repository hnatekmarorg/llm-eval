## Overview  

The script is a **graph‑traversal visualiser** that explores a 10 × 10 grid using the moves of a chess knight.  
It starts at the upper‑left corner `(0, 0)`, marks that square as visited, and then repeatedly:

1. Pops a position from a *stack* (`positions` – LIFO order).  
2. Generates all eight knight‑move candidates from that square (`knight`).  
3. Keeps only the moves that stay inside the board and that have not been visited yet.  
4. Marks the new squares as visited (`True` in `matrix`) and pushes them onto the stack.  
5. Prints the whole board (`X` for visited, space for unvisited) and sleeps 0.5 s so you can watch the “growth” of the visited area.

When the stack becomes empty, the loop ends – by then **every square that is reachable by a knight from the start has been visited** (on a 10×10 board that is the whole board).

The program is essentially a **depth‑first flood‑fill** using knight moves, not a *knight’s tour* (it does not try to produce a Hamiltonian path).

## Detailed Walk‑through  

### Data structures  

| Name | Type | Meaning |
|------|------|----------|
| `matrix` | `list[list[bool]]` (10 × 10) | `True` ⇔ square has been visited. |
| `positions` | `list[tuple[int, int]]` | Stack of squares that still need to be expanded. |

Both structures are mutated **in‑place**; the functions also return the matrix (unnecessary, see “Redundancies”).

### Functions  

#### `knight(x, y)`  

```python
def knight(x: int, y: int):
    return [
        (x + 1, y + 2),
        (x + 2, y + 1),
        (x + 2, y - 1),
        (x + 1, y - 2),
        (x - 1, y - 2),
        (x - 2, y - 1),
        (x - 2, y + 1),
        (x - 1, y + 2),
    ]
```

* Returns the eight possible knight destinations *without* any boundary checks.  
* The order is the classic “clockwise” order starting from the “up‑right” move.

#### `jump(matrix, x, y)`  

```python
def jump(matrix, x: int, y: int):
    positions = []
    for (ox, oy) in knight(x, y):
        if ox < 0 or oy < 0:          # cheap reject of negatives
            continue
        try:
            if matrix[ox][oy]:        # already visited → ignore
                continue
            matrix[ox][oy] = True     # mark as visited
            positions.append((ox, oy))
        except IndexError:            # out‑of‑bounds → ignore
            pass
    return matrix, positions
```

* **Purpose:** expand from `(x, y)`, find all *new* squares reachable in a single knight move, mark them visited and return them.  
* **Boundaries:**  
  * `ox < 0 or oy < 0` handles the negative side cheaply.  
  * The `try/except IndexError` handles the positive side (exceeding the 10‑size).  
  * This works, but catching exceptions is slower than an explicit bounds check.  
* **Side‑effects:** `matrix` is mutated; returning it is unnecessary.  

#### `print_matrix(matrix)`  

```python
def print_matrix(matrix):
    print()
    print("#" * 10)
    res = {True: "X", False: " "}
    for row in matrix:
        print("".join([res[state] for state in row]))
```

* Prints a blank line, a separator `##########`, then the board row‑by‑row.  
* `X` marks visited squares, a space marks unvisited squares.  

### Main loop  

```python
positions = [(0, 0)]
matrix[0][0] = True

while len(positions) != 0:
    x, y = positions.pop()                # LIFO → depth‑first
    matrix, new_positions = jump(matrix, x, y)
    print_matrix(matrix)
    positions += new_positions             # extend stack
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

* Starts with only the origin in the stack.  
* `pop()` removes the **last** element → depth‑first traversal (a snake‑like pattern).  
* `positions += new_positions` appends the newly discovered squares to the *right* side, preserving the LIFO nature.  
* After each expansion the board is printed and the script pauses for half a second.  

When the stack empties, **all reachable squares** (in practice: all 100 squares) have been visited, and the script terminates.

---

## Correctness  

* **Reachability:** A knight’s graph on a board ≥ 5 × 5 is *connected* – any square can be reached from any other. Hence on a 10 × 10 board the algorithm will eventually visit **every** cell.  
* **No duplicates:** The check `if matrix[ox][oy]: continue` guarantees a square is only ever added once to `positions`.  
* **Termination:** Because each iteration removes one square from `positions` and adds at most 8 *new* squares, the total number of iterations is bounded by the number of cells (≤ 100). Therefore the loop always ends.  

**Edge‑case sanity check:**  

| Board size | Reachability from (0,0) | Expected final visited count |
|------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1 × 1      | Trivial (only start)     | 1 |
| 2 × 2, 3 × 3, 4 × 4 | Knight graph **disconnected** – many squares unreachable | ≤ board size |
| ≥ 5 × 5   | Connected                | board size (e.g., 100 for 10 × 10) |

If the script were run on a 4 × 4 board it would stop early, leaving a few squares permanently `False`. No bug, just a property of the knight’s graph.

---

## Complexity  

*Let N be the number of squares (N = 100 for 10 × 10).*

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Time** | Each visited cell examines up to 8 moves → **O(8 · N) = O(N)**. |
| **Space** | `matrix` → O(N), `positions` stack → ≤ N → **O(N)**. |
| **Extra overhead** | The `try/except` per candidate adds a small constant factor; a bounds‑check would be slightly faster. |
| **Wall‑clock** | With `time.sleep(0.5)` and 100 iterations the visualisation takes ≈ 50 s. Removing the sleep reduces runtime to a few milliseconds. |

---

## Style & Redundancy Issues  

| Issue | Why it matters | Simple fix |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| `jump` returns `matrix` even though it is mutated in‑place. | Misleads the caller into thinking a new matrix is created, adds an unnecessary tuple unpack. | Remove the return of `matrix`; just `return positions`. |
| `try/except IndexError` for bounds. | Exceptions are expensive compared with a simple conditional test. | Replace with `if 0 <= ox < len(matrix) and 0 <= oy < len(matrix[0]): …`. |
| Global mutable `matrix`. | Harder to test/reuse; function signatures become noisy. | Pass `matrix` explicitly (already done) and keep it local to a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. |
| No docstrings or type hints for `knight`, `jump`, `print_matrix`. | Reduces readability and IDE assistance. | Add `"""Generate knight moves"""` etc., and type hints (`-> List[Tuple[int, int]]`). |
| Magic numbers (`10`). | Ties the code to a 10×10 board; makes it non‑re‑usable. | Introduce a constant `SIZE = 10` (or command‑line argument) and use it everywhere (`[[False]*SIZE for _ in range(SIZE)]`). |
| `positions += new_positions` mutates the list while iterating over it elsewhere. | Not a bug here, but can be confusing. | Prefer `stack.extend(new_positions)`. |
| Printing each iteration without clearing the console → long scroll. | Makes the visualisation harder to follow. | Use `os.system('cls' if os.name=='nt' else 'clear')` before each `print_matrix` or use `curses`/`rich` for smoother animation. |
| No `__main__` guard. | If the file is imported as a module, the traversal runs automatically. | Wrap the main loop in `if __name__ == "__main__":`. |
| No way to change start position. | Limits experimentation. | Accept start coordinates from the user or via arguments. |
| No progress indicator / final summary. | Hard to know when it’s done without watching the prints. | After the loop, `print(f"Visited {sum(row.count(True) for row in matrix)} squares.")`. |

## Refactored Version (illustrative)

Below is a compact, more idiomatic rewrite that addresses the points above while preserving the original visual effect.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import time
from typing import List, Tuple

SIZE = 10          # board dimension
SLEEP = 0.5        # seconds between frames


def knight_moves(x: int, y: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """All eight L‑shaped moves a knight can make from (x, y)."""
    return [
        (x + 1, y + 2), (x + 2, y + 1), (x + 2, y - 1), (x + 1, y - 2),
        (x - 1, y - 2), (x - 2, y - 1), (x - 2, y + 1), (x - 1, y + 2),
    ]


def expand(board: List[List[bool]], x: int, y: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Mark all unvisited, in‑bounds knight destinations from (x, y)."""
    new = []
    for nx, ny in knight_moves(x, y):
        if 0 <= nx < SIZE and 0 <= ny < SIZE and not board[nx][ny]:
            board[nx][ny] = True
            new.append((nx, ny))
    return new


def draw(board: List[List[bool]]) -> None:
    """Clear the console and render the board."""
    os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')
    print('#' * SIZE)
    for row in board:
        print(''.join('X' if cell else ' ' for cell in row))


def main(start: Tuple[int, int] = (0, 0)) -> None:
    board = [[False] * SIZE for _ in range(SIZE)]
    sx, sy = start
    board[sx][sy] = True

    stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(sx, sy)]

    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()               # depth‑first
        stack.extend(expand(board, x, y))
        draw(board)
        time.sleep(SLEEP)

    visited = sum(row.count(True) for row in board)
    print(f"\nDone – visited {visited}/{SIZE*SIZE} squares.")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

*Key changes*  

* `SIZE` and `SLEEP` are constants.  
* Bounds are checked with a simple `if`.  
* `expand` returns only the list of newly discovered squares.  
* `draw` clears the terminal before printing, giving a true “animation”.  
* A final summary tells you how many squares were visited.  

Feel free to replace `stack.pop()` with `stack.pop(0)` (or use `collections.deque`) to turn the algorithm into **breadth‑first** (radial wave) instead of depth‑first.

---

## Possible Extensions  

### 1.  Knight’s Tour (Hamiltonian path)  

The current code does **not** try to find a path that visits every square *exactly once* without back‑tracking.  
A classic way to do that:

| Approach | Sketch |
|----------|--------|
| **Backtracking** | Recursively try each legal move, backtrack if you reach a dead‑end. |
| **Warnsdorff’s heuristic** | Always move to the square with the fewest onward moves (greedy, works for most board sizes). |
| **Divide‑and‑conquer / pattern based** | Known closed tours for even boards can be generated algorithmically. |

Implementing a full tour would require:

* Keeping the *order* of moves (e.g., an integer step number per cell).  
* A recursive DFS that **unmarks** a cell on backtrack (`board[x][y] = False`).  
* Early exit once `step == SIZE*SIZE`.  

### 2.  Parameterising Board Size  

Expose `SIZE` as a command‑line argument (`argparse`) so you can experiment with 5×5, 8×8, 12×12, etc.  
Be aware that connectivity fails for sizes < 5; you can detect that and warn the user.

### 3.  Visual Enhancements  

* Use the **`rich`** library for coloured output (`[green]X[/]`), a progress bar, or live‑updating panels.  
* Use **`curses`** (Unix) or **`windows-curses`** for true terminal animation without flicker.  
* Render the board as a PNG (e.g., Pillow) and display each frame in a GUI window.  

### 4.  Performance Profiling  

If you strip the `time.sleep` and printing, the whole traversal finishes in < 0.01 s for a 100‑cell board.  
You could benchmark the two bounding‑check strategies (exception vs. conditional) with `timeit` – the conditional version is ~2–3× faster.

### 5.  Unit Tests  

```python
def test_knight_moves_center():
    assert set(knight_moves(4, 4)) == {
        (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 3), (5, 2),
        (3, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 6)
    }

def test_full_coverage():
    board = [[False]*SIZE for _ in range(SIZE)]
    board[0][0] = True
    stack = [(0, 0)]
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        for nx, ny in expand(board, x, y):
            stack.append((nx, ny))
    assert all(all(row) for row in board)  # all squares visited
```

Running these under `pytest` validates core logic independent of the visualisation.

---

## Summary  

* The script **visualises** a depth‑first flood‑fill of a 10 × 10 board using knight moves.  
* It is **correct** for boards ≥ 5 × 5 (the knight graph is connected).  
* Complexity is linear in the number of squares (≈ 100) – trivial for modern hardware.  
* Minor inefficiencies (exception handling for bounds, returning the matrix) and a lack of modularity make the code harder to reuse or extend.  
* Refactoring can improve readability, speed, and configurability while preserving the original effect.  
* With modest extensions you can turn the demo into a full‑featured **knight’s‑tour solver**, a parameterised explorer, or a polished terminal animation.

Feel free to copy the refactored version above as a clean starting point for any of those directions!

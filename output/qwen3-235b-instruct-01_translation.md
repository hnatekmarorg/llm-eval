On a treetop above the lake  
sat the Water Goblin at twilight:  
"Shine, little moon, shine,  
so my thread may glow bright.

I'm sewing, sewing little shoes,  
for dry land and waters to use:  
shine, little moon, shine,  
so my thread may glow bright.

Today is Thursday, tomorrow Fridayâ€”  
I'm sewing, sewing a little jacket:  
shine, little moon, shine,  
so my thread may glow bright.

Green dress, little red shoes,  
tomorrow will be my wedding news:  
shine, little moon, shine,  
so my thread may glow bright."
